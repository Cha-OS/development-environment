# Markdown

## WYSIWYG

### Typora

+ https://typora.io/
+ a great editor for markdown with WYSIWYG support
+ with native OSX support for tabs, you can have multi-tab support

### Preview view only

+ https://ia.net/writer
+ a great editor that supports Ted's **transclusion**
+ Problems
  + syncing doesn't seems well sometimes
  + it bothers with libs and injecting everything in libs
    + but you can add additional folder as lib and then it is easier
    + NOTE: do not add big fodlers, it might completely crash editor

### Atom

+ https://atom.io/
+ a great open source editor
+ you can get a tone of markdown components and make writing fast
+ we still didn't find any WYSIWYG component
