# Introduction

A plenty of useful guidances on using development, building, deploying, tools

here are different folders addressing different phases of development, and different subfolders addressing different components in the each phase

We are mostly focused on the ***MEAN*** stack so we will provide mostly documentation on that part, but addressing many other general technologies, 
like streaming, storages, collaboration, editors we use (Atom, ...)
